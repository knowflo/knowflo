# Knowflo

Knowflo is a super basic Q&A platform for public and private groups. It
was developed (in a hurry!) to facilitate knowledge sharing for a couple
small communities.

It isn't pretty. It isn't really finished. And yes, it uses the Twitter
Bootstrap default theme. Because I'm a lazy, lazy person who has far too
many other projects.

Did I mention that we're happy to accept pull requests? :)

## Public Server

There's a public hosted version of Knowflo running on
[Heroku](http://knowflo.info) that you can try out if you like. Note
that the public test group may be cleaned out from time to time.

## Note on Patches / Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
